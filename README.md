# The XMLParser Project
### by Petar Angelov [Shannarra](https://www.github.com/Shannarra)  

### The Idea.  
The idea behind this project is realy simple - to create a __*fully-automated*__ parser from special __XML-styled__ files with the special __*.sashs*__ extension to working C# .NET code.  

### How does it work and how to use it?

After booting the program will want you to give it a __path__ to specified __*.sashs*__ file and destination to __place the new file__.
If the file has different extension you'll get __ERROR__.  
> Still under development..   

Full explanation of how  the program works [here](https://github.com/Shannarra/XMLParser/blob/master/XMLParser/README.md).  

In a nutshell [the program](https://github.com/Shannarra/XMLParser/blob/master/XMLParser) will __read__ the given __*.sashs*__ file and turn it into __working C# code__.
